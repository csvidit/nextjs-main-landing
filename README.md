# nextjs-main-landing

In-production integrated portfolio, combining my projects in CS, academic papers, and original literature together. Made in NextJS with a number of other libraries, including

* [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
* [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/docs)
* [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.dev)
* [popmotion](https://popmotion.io/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To run run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
